    "Deprivation index data is at the LSOA level, but is already officially aggregated at the LAD level. So we need to produce our own aggregation at the Ward level. This is made more complicated because wards and LSOAs don't usually map neatly into one another, as described in [this github issue](https://github.com/yanoak/360giving-deprivation/issues/8). A workaround is to have an [official lookup table](http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/lower-layer-super-output-area-2011-to-ward-2017-lookup-in-england-and-wales) that matches LSOAs (2011) to Wards (2017) using a [best fitting method](http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets?q=Building%202011%20Census%20estimates) that relies on population weighted centroids of Output Areas.\n",
